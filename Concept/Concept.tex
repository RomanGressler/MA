\section{Concept}
In this section a concept of a mobile \enquote{\gls{see}} version will be presented. 
Therefore, a prototype will be created to point out the features that a mobile version of \enquote{\gls{see}} requires. \\
Prototypes are a common way to express the needs of a system. 
It is a low-cost way of planning an implementation, that can highlight challenges regarding constraints of a system early on.

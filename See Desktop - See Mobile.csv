Joysticks sind etwas zu weit in den Ecken, dadurch rotation etc langsam/schwierig. vielleicht occlusion culling oder wie das heißt um nicht alle städte zu rendern, da performanceeinbrüche wenn alle städte angeguckt werden"

Das Zoomen war vom Gefühl her verkehrt herum als bei anderen Apps (Hineinzoomen und Herauszoomen). Von der Übersicht wäre es besser, wenn man in die City hineinzoomt und nicht einen Ausschnitt vergrößert, da man sonst eher die Orientierung verliert. Es benötigt weit aus mehr Übung, um gezielte Aktion ausführen zu können."

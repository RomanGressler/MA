\label{research}
The central research question of this thesis is: Are Android smartphones suitable of working with \enquote{\gls{see}}?

To answer this question this thesis will discuss a general concept to implement \enquote{\gls{see}} on mobile devices in chapter \ref{section:concept}.
Afterwards the specific details of implementation will be introduced in chapter \ref{section:implementation}. 
The research question will then be answered in chapter \ref{section:evaluation} with an evaluation where the implemented mobile version of \enquote{\gls{see}} will be compared with the desktop version.
Last but not least this thesis will discuss further research and give a conclusion in chapter \ref{section:conclusion}.
